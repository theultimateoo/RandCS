This Java program simulates a crossword. 

All features required on the CS website have been implemented.
There aren't any bugs to be expected.


Instructions for running the code:
1. Edit CrossTest.java by changing the size of the crossword to any size. 
2. Edit CrossTest.java by changing the words, starting position, and orientation (either "ACROSS" or "DOWN"), but keep in the form of: c.addWord("WORD", row #, column #, orientation)
3. Compile CrossTest.java and Crossword.java.
4. Run CrossTest.class.
